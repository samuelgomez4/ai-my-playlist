## About AIMyPlaylist
AIMyPlaylist is a demo of a tool that lets you use AI to personalize your playlists in ways that current music streaming services don’t offer. The inspiration for this tool comes from the need to quickly create playlists—or, more importantly, edit existing ones in seconds—without manually adding or removing songs one by one. Even though streaming services are starting to integrate AI tools, these have limitations. For example, Spotify introduced a new feature that enables users to create playlists from a prompt. Essentially, it generates a playlist from scratch, and users can make further modifications based on this newly created playlist. However, there is no functionality that allows users to modify an existing playlist from their profile using AI or to create a new playlist that includes both a prompt and an existing playlist as context. Additionally, Spotify's AI feature is limited to premium users and is only available in a few countries.

> While AIMyPlaylist is still a demo, it will be integrated with Spotify once the extended quota is approved, allowing everyone to use it—whether they have a Spotify Premium account or not.
