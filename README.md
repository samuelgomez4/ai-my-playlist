On the other hand, Spotify introduces a new feature that enables users to create playlists from a prompt. Essentially, it generates a playlist from scratch, and users can make further modifications based on this newly created playlist. However, there is no functionality that allows users to modify an existing playlist from their profile using AI or to create a new playlist that includes both a prompt and an existing playlist as context. Additionally, Spotify's AI feature is limited to premium users and is only available in a few countries.
